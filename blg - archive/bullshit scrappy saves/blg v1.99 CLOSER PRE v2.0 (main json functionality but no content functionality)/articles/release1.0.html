                <h2>Wow finally its done (for now) and theres totally no bugs
                </h2>
                <p>Okay this is the final post for now about this project hopefully. I should be able to 
                    release v1.0 now after a lil while of pain xx - A lot of the time waiting was just school 
                    and lack of inspiration to continue but there were a few fixes ive done to be ready for full release: <br><br>
                    - Added instagram link <br>- Added filters to what was just a key <br>- Fixed issue where key would go 
                    over the page on mobile <br>- Added an icon for the google tab menu <br>- Added a description on the google 
                    search page <br><br>That final fix I don't know if it has worked yet because I'll have to wait until google 
                    updates their severs or something idk. That and a few other things means there may be a few bug fixes in the coming 
                    weeks but this blog is still feature complete now woohoo!
