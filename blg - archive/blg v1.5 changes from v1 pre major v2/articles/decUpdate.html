                <h2>There are a few big improvements I'd love to make that will wait until the December Holidays
                </h2>
                <p>Now that the website is actually somewhat reliably running and in a complete state there is a lot 
                    that I have wanted to add since the start without much of an idea on how to start at the time. Some things I wanna add:
                    <br><br>- An admin login at the bottom where the following can be edited online rather than in the back-end like I am now
                    <br>- Most importantly adding new posts
                    <br>- Home button instead of relying on browser based navigation tools
                    <br>- Change the blog icon
                    <br>- Make the description on Google better (I thought this was fixed :P)
                    <br>- Changing the colour scheme (this involves changing colours from a specified colour to a variable)
                    <br>- Changing anything else like icons banners and the bio
                    <br>- And finally hopefully making HTTPS work
                    <br><br>This will let me get better at javascript hopefully as a lot of this is script based not just HTML and CSS
                </p>   
                    <br><h4>
                        Other project related things:
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully at christmas i'll be able to buy a 3D printer (and a klein bottle) to be able to build 
                        neat lil projects like one ive seen where its a waveform visualisation (it might not actually be called that) 
                        but like the ones you see on youtube and in video editors.
                        <br>Thats it for now!
                    </p>
