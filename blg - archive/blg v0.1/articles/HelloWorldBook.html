                    Wooo! Good book! I love Hannah Fry so that was going to be obvious. I was probably first introduced 
                    to her in my sweet little careless fun maths lessons of year 7 oblivious to the stressful work ahead - 
                    we watched Numberphile videos (Youtube) and she must have come up somewhere but I specifically remember 
                    her opitmal way to cut a cake video (which now and then she still makes food related maths videos). Now 
                    I watch her when she pops up on Matt Parker's channel now and then.<br><br>Back to the book - it was great 
                    the chapters gave a wonderful insight into how much relevance algorithms have in our daily lives and how 
                    they can actually have quite the impact good or bad. I especially found the chapter on data brokers interesting 
                    due to my rough knowledge of the subject but without knowing the detail. This fascination she has brought to me 
                    I am planning on attempting to pass on to an audience through a TEDx talk but I doubt ill get as interesting as 
                    her (interesting at all will be a feat).<br><br>As a first read in a series of me reading books adjacent to computer 
                    science but focusing on the philosophical and moral aspects of the subject, It was a wonderful start with as fun an 
                    introduction as possible and has made me begin to understand more of the philosophy that I was interested in behind the way we interact with technology.
