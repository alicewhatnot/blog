                <h2>So i figured out how to host a web server (kinda) and it took ages but here we are - its 
                    mikegillbanks.co.uk but you know that already
                </h2>
                <p>Oh my goodness that was a pain xx <br>So anyway I looked into hosting the website on the laptop 
                    that is just sitting there in the corner of my room and tried a method I found from a youtube 
                    video. I got so far in until realising when hosting through wordpress there seems to be no way of just 
                    uploading the files with the code you wrote. (its harder to host your own than make it online???) 
                    So with that out the window I tried simply using a static IP but apparently that isn't available 
                    for my homes internet. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>The solution I have working now:
                </h4>
                <p>I am using amazon's web server hosting system lightsail - this and hostinger seemed to be the two clear  
                    options with hostinger being cheaper but needing an upfront payment for 4 years while amazon is 5 dollars 
                    a month. On lightsail I have an ubuntu instance running apache2 which just uses a directory copied across from 
                    my PC using filezilla (The key for this being rejected being 1 of 2 times I needed to delete the instance and retry) 
                    Looking back (as long as it's working) everything I did does seem quite straightforward so now I might finally be able 
                    to focus on pushing updates to the website and streamlining updating pages in my free time instead of looking into 
                    the canyon of pain and suffering that is web hosting.
