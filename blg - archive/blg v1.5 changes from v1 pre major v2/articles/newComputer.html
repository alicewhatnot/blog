                <h1>New Computer! (and putting off coding)</h1>h1>
                <h3>21-12-24</h3>
                <h2>Built a new computer - its smaller and faster and quieter!
                </h2>
                <p>So its been a while! A bit busy working on multiple essays and generally working more towards grades 
                    than projects in my own free time recently. This is however being written on a new computer that I 
                    built last week - its an ITX case (The Fractal Terra) with 13th gen i5 CPU and an RTX4060 carried over 
                    from my last PC. <br><br> While the 13600KF is just over two years old its performance is in line with 
                    the generation newer (around 4% worse) and even performs better than Intel's latest chips that are the 
                    product of them focusing on power efficency. I could've gone AMD but at the price that I got the 13600KF 
                    for it was well worth it (£170). <br><br>Being that this computer is so much smaller than my last (40L down to 10) 
                    I assumed there would be problems with thermals however while I have had to limit the CPU to 180W peak 160W sustained 
                    that is still far above its rated power draw and is kept virtually silent at 40°C at idle with only a minimal less 
                    than 1% performance drop compared to stock under full core loads.<br><br>I am somewhat working on making the website 
                    easier to post to but since it seems such a bigger task compared to usual im quite apparently putting it off... I should 
                    finish updating the website at least before the start of school again so Ill be back in another post then in the new year!
