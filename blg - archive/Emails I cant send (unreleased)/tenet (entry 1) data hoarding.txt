I think it is of importance to me that I save and store as much digital data associated with me that I can. Movies I like, every photo I've taken (doing this already), thoughts on things I have (diary?) and maybe even the texts I have from all platforms. This is non exhaustive - any other data type I can think of I want to store. 
Yea maybe this is data hoarding but as of now storage is cheap and can be replaced when it fails. There is always the threat that data saved may not be readable in the future but as of now this is proved possible. (As long as I keep updating the storage medium everything is on)
This file I am writing on will not be uploaded to my website for a little while - that is if it is ever uploaded or if I have moved on from then. It is too personal a thing I think - that is to have my exact plan and thought - to be given out to the world and more exactly my family.
The main point here is that I need everything I do to be in a concise location so that in the future I have a very powerful record of everything I have done and felt and spoken and watched and loved. The emotional power that music gives to me may also be important to store as a reminder of what I could be influenced by and how strong the motivation can be (I'm listening to the TENET soundtrack right now) but I just know that even if this doesn't make much sense, internally I know what I must do for the sake of my own peace x.
For now a lot of these entries may be kept off the record for my own personal mystique xo.

Edit:
oh good this means downloading every media ever like music and movies and imma need a hell of a storage solution - some things (movies) may have to be kept for a day where I can invest more in this project.
