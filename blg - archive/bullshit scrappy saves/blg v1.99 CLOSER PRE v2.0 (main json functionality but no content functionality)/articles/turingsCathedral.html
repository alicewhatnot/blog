                <h2>★★★<br><br>An interesting (but somewhat tedious) insight into the beginnings of computer science
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This book was read over the end of the half term and this review (its not really a review) is a little late because of exams 
                    and things but its given me time to think about this review more. To get past the fact that I gave it 3 stars first, it was 
                    quite a boring read to me. Some parts where the author goes into detail about history that I did not find entirely relevant 
                    to the general topic felt like they dragged on a bit. However, between these spells there was a fascinating insight into early 
                    computer science. A lot of the early background information I found more interesting possibly because it built on the history present in 
                    Oppenheimer (the movie) - by Christopher Nolan. Turing's Cathedral built on the loose history (what can you expect from a historical drama) 
                    to show how key the usecase of calculating the effect of explosions was to the research and building of the computer. It made me think that 
                    quite possibly without the atomic race during the war and the continuing race to build a bigger bomb, computers would never have existed. 
                    The book opened a whole can of worms in me thinking about this part of the history of computer science - a subject that previously I don't 
                    think I would ever have considered I would be remotely interested in. 
                    <br><br>
                    Contrary to the title (Although Alan Turing was mentioned a lot) the book also focused on the life of John Von Neumann which was fascinating. The author spoke of his interesting questions rather than the 
                    usual - how fast does it go? (which is totally what id ask). Studying this man really helped the picture of how computer science came to be.
                    <br><br>
                    My last remark is how funny it is that even in the early days of computer science, according to the author, the people working on 
                    computers were said to be engineers by the mathematics department but the mathematics department didnt want anything to do with them as 
                    computing apparently was not mathematics (it totally is). So even though it was kind of boring at the time, im glad I read it. <br><br>
